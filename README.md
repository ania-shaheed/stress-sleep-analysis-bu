# Undergraduate Stress and Sleep at Boston University

This project investigates whether students’ academic majors (STEM vs. non-STEM) are associated with their stress levels and average sleep, using data collected from 105 undergraduates at Boston University.

## Research Questions
1. Is there a statistically significant difference in perceived stress levels between different academic majors?
2. Does being in a STEM major affect how much sleep a student gets?

## Methodology
- Surveyed 105 BU undergraduates
- Cleaned and processed data in Python
- Visualized distributions using Seaborn/Matplotlib
- Ran chi-squared and Fisher’s exact tests

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Raw and cleaned CSV datasets
- `notebooks/`: Exploratory data analysis
- `figures/`: Visualizations used in report
- `papers/`: Final PDF write-up
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies used in the analysis

## Key Findings
- No statistically significant relationship was found between major type and stress or sleep levels.
- Future work: Increase sample size and control for more confounding variables.

## Dependencies
See `requirements.txt` for Python package dependencies.
